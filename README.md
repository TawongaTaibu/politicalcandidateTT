## Running the Application

### Using venv

    ```

   Replace `manage.py` with the entry point of your application if different.

2. **Access the application in your browser:**

    Visit `http://localhost:8000` or the appropriate URL specified in your application.

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t dfa .
    ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 8000:8000 dfa
    ```

   Adjust the port and image name as needed.

3. **Access the application in your browser:**

    Visit `http://localhost:8000` or the appropriate URL specified in your Docker configuration.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to add sensitive information such as passwords or API tokens to a `.env` file. This file should not be committed to your Git repository. Ensure your `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude this file.

## Usage
Firstly, you have to open the projects folder on your IDE and click *RUN* or by clicking 
an inverted triangle pointing to the left which is on the top right corner
if you're using *Visual Studio Code*. This allows you to go to the root directory of the project
and this is where you run the *python manage.py runserver* command. After a successful launch, a user is welcomed
by the *Home Page* of the political candidate and from here they are able to navigate to other pages of this webpage.
For example, if a user is willing to view the news of the political party he/she should be a registered and logged in user.
